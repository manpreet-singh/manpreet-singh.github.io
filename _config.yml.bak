          I started this project as a way of learning <mark>Embedded Systems</mark> design and it has since grown into a fully fledged robot. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio.

          Some of the skills I've picked up while doing this project:
          - C/C++ , Python
          - ROS (Robot Operating System)
          - Embedded hardware design with STM32 micro-controllers
          - Digital Signal processing with Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)
          - PCB Design and Assembly
          - Power Management topology with Lithium-Ion Batteries

          At this role I performed Design Validation on the Surface line of computer products. Some of my achievements and responsibilities 
            Develop internal tools for data collection, ingest, and analysis automation using C# and Python.
            Develop and maintain test equipment and test stands consisting of multiple Oscilloscopes, DMMs, Function Generators, and Current Probes for mixed Analog and Digital testing and Verification.
            Developed test automation software with C# and Python using VISA and SCPI to interface with various test instruments.
            Carry out display verification by taking ownership of test pass planning and execution for various display subsystems across a product line from an electrical and optical point of view. Review PCB layouts using Cadence Allegro PCB viewer, develop PCB rework guides for electrical testing.
            Verification of MIPI, I2C, SPI, DP, eDP, Signal Integrity, complex power sequences, display driver ICs, and multi-display synchronization.
            Thoroughly document issues from electrical and optical points of vie

          During my time at UW Tacoma, I honed and refined my skills that I can taken through my career such as teamwork and working with tight deadlines. I enjoyed my time at UW Tacoma and learnt a lot about what a healthy work life balance is. 
          
          Some of the skills I picked up while here include : 
          - 3D Printing
          - Mechanical Design
          - Software Design for Embedded Systems
          - Image processing 
          - Control System
          - Digital Signal Processing

          I spent some time with the IEEE Robotics Club at UW Tacoma, initially during the first year I helped wherever I was needed. I was a jack of *most* trades taking on the role of *Project Manager*.
